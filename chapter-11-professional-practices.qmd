## The Concept First

Writing code that works is one thing. Writing code that **works reliably, can be maintained, and collaborates well** is professional practice. This chapter covers the practices that distinguish professional developers.

## Understanding Through Craftsmanship

A carpenter's table might function whether it's measured once or twice. But professional carpenters measure twice because they've learned the cost of mistakes. Professional practices are your "measure twice."

## Discovering Professionalism with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Version Control

```
Ask your AI:
Explain Git to someone who has never used version control. Why should they care?
```

### Exploration 2: Testing Philosophy

```
Ask your AI:
Why do professional developers write tests? What's the business case?
```

### Exploration 3: Code Quality

```
Ask your AI:
What makes code "good"? Create a checklist for reviewing your own code.
```
