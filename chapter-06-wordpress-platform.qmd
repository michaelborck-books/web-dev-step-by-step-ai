## The Concept First

WordPress isn't just blogging software – it's a **platform** with an ecosystem of themes, plugins, and APIs. Understanding WordPress as a platform helps you make better technology decisions.

## Understanding Through Ecosystems

Think of WordPress like a smartphone. The core provides basics, but the app ecosystem makes it powerful. Choosing the right "apps" (plugins/themes) is as important as the platform itself.

## Discovering WordPress with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Platform Thinking

```
Ask your AI:
What makes something a "platform" vs just "software"? Use WordPress and Excel as examples.
```

### Exploration 2: Ecosystem Evaluation

```
Ask your AI:
How do you evaluate whether a WordPress theme or plugin is trustworthy? What red flags should you watch for?
```

### Exploration 3: Architecture

```
Ask your AI:
Explain WordPress's architecture (database, themes, plugins) using a restaurant analogy
```
