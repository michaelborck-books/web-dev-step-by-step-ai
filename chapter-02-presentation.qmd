## The Concept First

CSS controls how structured content looks. But it's more than decoration – it's **visual communication**. Colours, spacing, and layout convey meaning, guide attention, and build trust.

## Understanding Through Design

Think of two cafés with identical menus but different interiors. The food is the same (content), but the atmosphere (presentation) creates completely different experiences.

CSS is your atmosphere.

## Discovering Presentation with Your AI Partner

```

### Exploration 2: Mobile-First

```
Ask your AI:
Explain mobile-first design as a business strategy, not just a technical approach
```

### Exploration 3: Visual Hierarchy

```
Ask your AI:
How does visual hierarchy guide user attention? Show me with a simple example.
```
