## The Concept First

Platforms become powerful through extensions. WordPress plugins add functionality without changing core code. But **when do you use an existing plugin vs build custom?** This is a critical business decision.

## Understanding Through Build vs Buy

Every extension decision weighs:

- **Time**: How long to build vs install?
- **Cost**: Development vs licensing?
- **Maintenance**: Who updates it?
- **Fit**: Does it solve 80% or 100% of the need?

## Discovering Extensions with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Plugin Evaluation

```
Ask your AI:
I need a contact form for WordPress. Create a framework for evaluating the top 3 options.
```

### Exploration 2: Build vs Buy

```
Ask your AI:
A client needs a booking system. Walk me through the decision process for using a plugin vs building custom.
```

### Exploration 3: Technical Debt

```
Ask your AI:
What is "plugin bloat"? How do too many plugins create technical debt?
```

## From Concept to Code

[To be developed: Plugin installation, evaluation, basic customisation, child themes, functions.php]

## Business Applications

*This develops ULO 4 – making and defending technology choices.*

- **ROI calculation**: Development cost vs plugin cost
- **Risk assessment**: Plugin abandonment, security
- **Client communication**: Explaining trade-offs
- **Long-term thinking**: Maintenance burden

## Next Steps

In Chapter 8, we'll explore headless architecture – using WordPress as a content backend while building custom frontends. This bridges your CMS knowledge with modern frontend development.
