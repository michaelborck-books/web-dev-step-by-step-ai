## The Concept First

HTML provides structure. CSS provides presentation. JavaScript provides **behaviour** – the ability to respond to user actions, update content dynamically, and create interactive experiences.

## Understanding Through Conversation

A static page is like a poster. JavaScript makes your page more like a conversation – it listens, responds, and adapts.

## Discovering Behaviour with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Event-Driven Thinking

```
Ask your AI:
Explain event-driven programming using a restaurant service analogy
```

### Exploration 2: DOM Manipulation

```
Ask your AI:
What is the DOM? Explain it as if describing how a librarian rearranges books.
```

### Exploration 3: Progressive Enhancement

```
Ask your AI:
Why should websites work without JavaScript? Explain the business case.
```

## From Concept to Code

[To be developed: Variables, functions, events, DOM manipulation, async basics]

## Business Applications

- **User engagement**: Interactive features increase engagement
- **Form validation**: Prevent errors before submission
- **Dynamic content**: Update without page reload
- **Analytics**: Track user behaviour

## Practice Exercises

[Exercises to be developed]

## Chapter Summary

- JavaScript enables interaction
- Event-driven thinking is fundamental
- Progressive enhancement ensures accessibility
- Behaviour enhances but shouldn't replace structure

## Next Steps

In Chapter 4, we'll connect to the world through APIs – fetching data from other services and sending data to servers. This transforms standalone pages into connected applications.
