# Project: Portfolio Website {#sec-project-portfolio}

## Project Overview

Your first substantial project brings together everything from Part I: Structure (HTML), Presentation (CSS), Behaviour (JavaScript), and Connection (APIs). You'll build a personal portfolio website—a professional asset that demonstrates your capabilities to future employers or clients.

This isn't just an academic exercise. A well-crafted portfolio is one of the most valuable tools for launching a career in web development or digital business.

**Aligned with**: Assessment 1 in ISYS3004

## Learning Outcomes Addressed

- **ULO 1**: Design, implement, and evaluate effective business web applications
- **ULO 3**: Analyse stakeholder requirements to inform design decisions
- **ULO 5**: Evaluate and apply appropriate web technologies

## The Business Case

Consider this project from a business perspective. Your portfolio serves multiple stakeholders:

- **Potential employers** want to see what you can build and how you think
- **Clients** want confidence that you understand professional standards
- **You** need a platform to showcase growth over time

Ask yourself: What does your portfolio need to communicate? Not just "I can code" but "I understand business needs, I write clean code, I think about users."

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Your portfolio must include:

1. **Home page**: Clear introduction establishing who you are and what you do
2. **About section**: Your background, skills, and professional interests
3. **Projects showcase**: At least three projects or work samples with descriptions
4. **Contact information**: How someone can reach you professionally
5. **Responsive design**: Works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop
6. **API integration**: At least one meaningful use of external data

### Technical Requirements

| Requirement | Standard |
|------------|----------|
| HTML | Semantic HTML5 (appropriate use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) |
| CSS | Mobile-first responsive design with Flexbox/Grid |
| JavaScript | At least one interactive feature using event listeners |
| API | At least one API call displaying external data |
| Accessibility | Basic WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (semantic structure, alt text, colour contrast, keyboard navigation) |
| Version control | Git repository with meaningful commit history |
| Deployment | Live URL (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar) |

### What Counts as API Integration?

Choose one or more:

- **GitHub API**: Display your repositories or contribution activity
- **Weather API**: Show local weather (perhaps themed to where you're based)
- **Quote API**: Display rotating inspirational or industry quotes
- **JSON data file**: If external APIs are problematic, create your own JSON file of project data and fetch it
- **Other**: Any public API that adds genuine value (not just demonstrating you can fetch data)

The integration should be meaningful—it should serve a purpose for someone viewing your portfolio, not just prove you can make an API call.

## Project Approach

### Phase 1: Planning (Before Any Code)

1. **Define your audience**: Who will view this portfolio? What do they need?
2. **Content inventory**: List all the content you'll need (text, images, project descriptions)
3. **Structure outline**: Sketch your page structure—what sections, what hierarchy?
4. **Visual direction**: What atmosphere suits your professional identity?

```
Ask your AI:
Help me plan a portfolio website structure. I want to showcase myself
as [your professional focus]. What sections should I include, and
what should each communicate to a potential employer?
```

### Phase 2: HTML Structure

Build your complete HTML structure before styling:

1. Create semantic markup for all pages/sections
2. Validate your HTML (W3C Validator)
3. Test that the content makes sense without any CSS
4. Ensure heading hierarchy is logical (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping)

This phase should produce an "ugly but functional" page—all content present, properly structured, but unstyled.

### Phase 3: CSS Styling

Apply styles mobile-first:

1. Base styles (typography, colours, spacing)
2. Mobile layout (single column, readable)
3. Tablet breakpoint (adjust layout as needed)
4. Desktop breakpoint (multi-column where appropriate)
5. Interactive states (hover, focus)

```
Ask your AI:
Review this CSS for my portfolio. Am I following mobile-first
principles? What could be simplified or improved?
```

### Phase 4: JavaScript Interactivity

Add behaviour that enhances the experience:

1. Navigation toggle for mobile
2. Smooth scrolling to sections (optional)
3. Form validation (if you have a contact form)
4. Any other interactive features

Remember progressive enhancement: your site should work without JavaScript.

### Phase 5: API Integration

Implement your API feature:

1. Choose an appropriate API
2. Handle loading states
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Display data meaningfully

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement

1. Test on multiple devices (or device emulators)
2. Test with keyboard navigation only
3. Run accessibility audit (Lighthouse, WAVE)
4. Fix any issues found
5. Get feedback from peers

## AI Collaboration Guidelines

### How to Use AI Effectively

This project is an opportunity to practice the collaboration skills from @sec-ai-web-partner. Use AI to:

- Explore approaches before committing
- Debug issues you can't resolve
- Get feedback on code quality
- Understand why something works, not just that it works

**Do not** use AI to:

- Generate your entire project and submit it
- Write content about yourself (you know yourself better)
- Skip understanding what the code does

### Documentation Requirements

Keep an AI collaboration log documenting:

1. **Prompts that helped**: What questions got useful responses?
2. **Modifications you made**: How did you adapt AI suggestions?
3. **AI errors or limitations**: What did AI get wrong? How did you know?
4. **Learning moments**: What did the collaboration teach you?

This log demonstrates critical thinking—that you're directing the AI, not just copying its output.

### Example Log Entry

```
Prompt: "Show me how to create a responsive navigation that collapses
to a hamburger menu on mobile"

AI Response: Provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a toggle menu.

What I Modified:
- Changed class names to match my naming convention
- Added ARIA attributes for accessibility (AI omitted these)
- Simplified the CSS transitions

What AI Got Wrong:
- Used var instead of const/let
- Didn't include focus states for keyboard users

What I Learned:
- The toggle pattern uses classList.toggle() which I hadn't used before
- Need to remember accessibility attributes AI often forgets
```

## Getting Started

Begin with these conversations with your AI partner:

```
Ask your AI:
I'm planning a portfolio website to showcase my web development
learning. Help me think through what sections I need and what each
should communicate to someone considering hiring a junior developer.
```

```
Ask your AI:
What makes a portfolio stand out? Not visually flashy features, but
professional qualities that employers actually notice. What should
I prioritise?
```

```
Ask your AI:
I want to integrate an API into my portfolio. Help me evaluate
options: GitHub API vs a weather API vs a quotes API. What would
make each one add genuine value versus feel gimmicky?
```

Remember: This portfolio is yours. AI can help you build it, but your decisions, your content, and your professional identity should drive it. You're the architect.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-designing**: Simple and professional beats flashy and distracting
2. **Under-writing**: "Check out my projects" tells employers nothing; explain what you did and learned
3. **Ignoring mobile**: Test on actual devices, not just browser resize
4. **Forgetting accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, colour contrast, alt text
5. **Copying AI output blindly**: If you can't explain it, you shouldn't submit it
6. **Leaving console errors**: Always check the browser console
7. **Placeholder content**: "Lorem ipsum" signals incompleteness

## After Submission

Your portfolio is a living document. After this project:

- Update it as you complete new work
- Refine based on feedback
- Keep the code clean and the content current

The best portfolios evolve. This submission is the beginning, not the end.
