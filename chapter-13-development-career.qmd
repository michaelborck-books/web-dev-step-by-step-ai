## The Concept First

Technical skills get you interviews. **Professional skills get you hired and promoted.** This chapter covers the non-technical aspects of a development career: portfolios, networking, communication, and continuous growth.

## Understanding Through Positioning

You're not just a developer – you're a professional who solves business problems with technology. How you position yourself matters as much as your technical skills.

## Discovering Career with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Portfolio Strategy

```
Ask your AI:
What should a junior web developer's portfolio demonstrate? Quality vs quantity?
```

### Exploration 2: Professional Communication

```
Ask your AI:
How do you explain technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders? Give examples.
```

### Exploration 3: Learning Path

```
Ask your AI:
I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and React. What should I learn next? How do I decide?
```
