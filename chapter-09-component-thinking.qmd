## The Concept First

React introduces **component thinking** – building interfaces from reusable, self-contained pieces. This isn't just a technology choice; it's a different way of thinking about user interfaces.

## Understanding Through LEGO

Think of LEGO bricks. Each brick is self-contained. Complex structures emerge from combining simple pieces. React components work the same way.

A page isn't a monolith – it's a composition of components.

## Discovering Components with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Decomposition

```
Ask your AI:
Look at a typical e-commerce product page. How would you break it into components? Draw a diagram.
```

### Exploration 2: State Thinking

```
Ask your AI:
Explain React state using a light switch analogy. Then a shopping cart analogy.
```

### Exploration 3: Props Flow

```
Ask your AI:
Explain how data flows through React components using a family tree analogy
```

## From Concept to Code

[To be developed: JSX, components, props, state, hooks, fetching data]

## Business Applications

- **Reusability**: Build once, use everywhere
- **Maintainability**: Change one component, update everywhere
- **Team collaboration**: Different developers own different components
- **Testing**: Test components in isolation

## Practice Exercises

[Exercises to be developed]

## Chapter Summary

- Components are reusable UI building blocks
- State represents what can change
- Props pass data between components
- Component thinking is a transferable skill

## Next Steps

In Chapter 10, we'll explore CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind – tools that accelerate development by providing pre-built components and utility classes. Combined with React, these enable rapid professional development.
