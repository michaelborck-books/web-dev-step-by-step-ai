## The Concept First

AI is transforming development. But **some things won't change**: understanding problems, communicating with stakeholders, making trade-offs, and exercising judgment. This chapter explores what it means to be a developer when AI can write code.

## Understanding Through Partnership

We started this book by establishing AI as your partner. Now let's reflect: What did you learn that AI couldn't learn for you? What can you do that AI can't?

## Discovering the Future with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: What Won't Change

```
Ask your AI:
What aspects of software development won't be automated by AI? Why?
```

### Exploration 2: Your Unique Value

```
Ask your AI:
What can a human developer do that AI cannot? Be specific.
```

### Exploration 3: Future Partnership

```
Ask your AI:
How might human-AI collaboration in development evolve over the next 5 years?
```
