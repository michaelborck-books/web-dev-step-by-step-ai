## The Concept First

In Part I, you built pages by writing code. But who updates that content? A CMS (Content Management System) separates content from code, allowing non-technical users to manage their own websites.

This is a **business decision**, not just a technical one.

## Understanding Through Roles

Think about a newspaper. Writers create content. Editors review it. Designers create templates. Each role focuses on what they do best.

A CMS enables this separation for websites.

## Discovering CMS with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Build vs Buy

```
Ask your AI:
When should a business build a custom website vs use a CMS? Create a decision framework.
```

### Exploration 2: Stakeholder Analysis

```
Ask your AI:
Who are the stakeholders in a website project? What does each need from a CMS?
```

### Exploration 3: Content Strategy

```
Ask your AI:
Explain content strategy for a small business website. What questions should we answer first?
```
