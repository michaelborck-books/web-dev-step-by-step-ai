## The Concept First

Traditional WordPress handles both content management AND presentation. **Headless** architecture separates these: WordPress manages content, but a separate frontend (React, for example) handles display.

This enables the best of both worlds.

## Understanding Through Separation

Imagine a restaurant where the kitchen (content) and dining room (presentation) are in different buildings. Orders (API requests) travel between them. Each can be optimised independently.

## Discovering Headless with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Architecture Trade-offs

```
Ask your AI:
Compare traditional WordPress vs headless WordPress. When would you choose each?
```

### Exploration 2: API Contracts

```
Ask your AI:
Explain how the WordPress REST API works as a "contract" between backend and frontend
```

### Exploration 3: Business Cases

```
Ask your AI:
Give me 3 real-world scenarios where headless WordPress makes business sense
```

## From Concept to Code

[To be developed: WordPress REST API, endpoints, authentication, fetching data]

## Business Applications

- **Multi-channel**: Same content to web, mobile, displays
- **Performance**: Static frontends are faster
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface
- **Developer experience**: Modern frontend tools

## Practice Exercises

## Chapter Summary

- Headless separates content from presentation
- REST APIs enable this separation
- Architecture choices have business implications
- The right architecture depends on requirements

## Next Steps

You've now mastered content management. In the Business Site Project, you'll build a complete WordPress site with custom functionality. Then we move to Part III, where we'll build a modern React frontend that consumes WordPress content.
