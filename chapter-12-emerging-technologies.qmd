## The Concept First

Technology changes constantly. The valuable skill isn't knowing today's tools – it's **systematically evaluating new technologies** to make informed recommendations. This chapter teaches you how to assess any technology, not just current ones.

## Understanding Through Frameworks

Don't ask "Is X good?" Ask:

- What problem does it solve?
- What trade-offs does it make?
- Who is using it successfully?
- What's the total cost of adoption?

## Discovering Evaluation with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Evaluation Framework

```
Ask your AI:
Create a framework for evaluating whether a business should adopt a new web technology
```

### Exploration 2: Hype vs Reality

```
Ask your AI:
How do you distinguish technology hype from genuine value? Give examples from web development history.
```

### Exploration 3: Current Landscape

```
Ask your AI:
What web technologies are gaining adoption in 2025? For each, what problem does it solve?
```
