## The Concept First

CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.) provide pre-built styles and components. They're **constraints that enable speed**. Instead of designing every button, you use consistent, tested patterns.

## Understanding Through Design Systems

Professional design teams use design systems – documented patterns for consistency. CSS frameworks are design systems you can adopt immediately.

## Discovering Frameworks with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Framework Comparison

```
Ask your AI:
Compare Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. When would you choose each?
```

### Exploration 2: Constraints as Features

```
Ask your AI:
How do constraints help creativity? Apply this to CSS frameworks.
```

### Exploration 3: Customisation

```
Ask your AI:
A client says their Bootstrap site "looks like every other site." How do you respond?
```

## From Concept to Code

## Next Steps

In Chapter 11, we'll cover professional practices – testing, version control, and code quality. These practices separate hobbyist projects from professional work.
