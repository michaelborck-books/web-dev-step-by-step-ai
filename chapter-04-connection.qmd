## The Concept First

No system exists in isolation. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different systems to communicate – your website can display weather data, process payments, or sync with inventory systems.

## Understanding Through Contracts

An API is like a contract between systems. It says: "If you send me this, I'll give you that." Both sides agree on the format, and communication flows.

## Discovering Connection with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: API Analogy

```
Ask your AI:
Explain REST APIs using a restaurant ordering system analogy
```

### Exploration 2: Data Formats

```
Ask your AI:
Why is JSON the standard format for API data? What problem does it solve?
```

### Exploration 3: Error Handling

```
Ask your AI:
What can go wrong when calling an API? How should a professional application handle each case?
```

## From Concept to Code

[To be developed: fetch(), JSON, async/await, error handling, CORS basics]

## Business Applications

- **Data integration**: Connect to business systems
- **Third-party services**: Payments, maps, analytics
- **Real-time updates**: Live data without refresh
- **Scalability**: Separate frontend from backend

## Practice Exercises

[Exercises to be developed]

## Chapter Summary

- APIs enable system integration
- HTTP methods have specific purposes
- Error handling is professional practice
- JSON is the common language

## Next Steps

You've now covered the foundations: HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), JavaScript (behaviour), and APIs (connection). In the Portfolio Project, you'll combine these skills to build a complete portfolio website. Then we move to Part II, where we explore content management systems.
