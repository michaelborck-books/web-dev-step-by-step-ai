## The Concept First

Before we write any HTML, let's understand what we're really doing: **organising information so both humans and machines can understand it**.

A web page is a document. Like any document – a book, a report, a menu – it has structure. HTML is simply the language we use to describe that structure.

## Understanding Through Architecture

Think of a building:

- The **foundation** supports everything
- **Walls** divide space into meaningful areas
- **Signs** tell you what each area is for
- **Doors** connect different spaces

HTML works the same way. Elements create structure. Tags label what things are.

## Discovering Structure with Your AI Partner

### Exploration 1: Document Anatomy

```
Ask your AI:
If I showed you a restaurant menu, what structural elements would you identify? Don't use any HTML terms yet.
```

### Exploration 2: Semantic Meaning

```
Ask your AI:
Explain "semantic HTML" using a library catalog analogy
```

### Exploration 3: Simplest Page

```
Ask your AI:
Show me the absolute simplest valid HTML page with just a heading and paragraph
```

## From Concept to Code

## Business Applications

Why structure matters for business:

- **SEO**: Search engines understand structured content
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers navigate structure
- **Maintenance**: Well-structured pages are easier to update
- **Professionalism**: Structure reflects organisational thinking

## Next Steps

In Chapter 2, we'll explore CSS – how to control the visual presentation of our structured content. Structure and presentation are deliberately separate, and understanding why is key to professional web development.
